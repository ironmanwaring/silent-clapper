## Silent Salutations

A fun little "silent-clapper" I built during a 24 hour hackathon. Silent Salutations uses sockets to connect people who are watching your presentation remotely and allows them to participatae in a visual-applaud (and more...depending on the icons available to them). 


## Get Started

Short and sweet:

```
npm install
npm start

Launch the app in your browser. Others can connect via IP address and watch their live silent-applauding take place. 
```
