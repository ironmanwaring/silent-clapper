Button Visual Feedback:
  More visual feedback when you press the buttons.
  On some buttons it is clear that there is a shadow when pressed.
  On others it is very hard to see.  
  It makes it hard to know how many times I am clicking.

Create a board:
  I get this error when adding the clap to my board.
    PickButtons.js:60 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'clap' of undefined.

Board number should still be visible when you are on the board so you can tell someone what board you are on while you are there. (Most people won't know that it is in the URI)

Favicon:
  I like the clap favicon, maybe remove the white background. I think it will look a little more professional.

console.logs:
  removed console.logs from master branch
  (ie. emitting console logs)

Reducers:
  There are a lot of single case reducers.  Not necessarily an issue, but it looks like some could be combined.

Spacing:
  Not important, but some of your files are 2 spaces per tab, others are 4.  It's weird when switching between the files.
